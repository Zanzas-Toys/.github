# Zanzas Toys

Hello, and welcome to the github profile for Zanzas Toys. We make 3d printable toys using open source tools.

To see what we make, have a look at:

- [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@zanzastoys)
- [our files at Cults3d](https://cults3d.com/en/users/zanzas_toys/3d-models)

Some of the things we make end up being heavily (or entirely) code-based, so it makes sense to share them here as well as repos.

Here you'll find our most parametric designs (using things like OpenSCAD and Cadquery), as well as source code for toy-related tools we make.

Enjoy!
